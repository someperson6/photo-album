<h1 title="This is my essay">Another unique example of heroism is Wangari Maathai, who was the first African woman to receive a Nobel Prize. After getting a doctorate she started an organization bringing people in Kenya together to plant more trees, and slow the desertification of her country. In that same organization she made, they established another one to spread their message to the world leaders. She also supported other issues and fought against them, like human rights, aids, and women's rights. </h1>
