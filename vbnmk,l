<h1 title="This is my essay">Another unique example of heroism is Wangari Maathai, who was the first African woman to receive a Nobel Prize. After getting a doctorate she started an organization bringing people in Kenya together to plant more trees, and slow the desertification of her country.

She also supported other issues and fought against them, like human rights, aids, and women's rights. </h1>
